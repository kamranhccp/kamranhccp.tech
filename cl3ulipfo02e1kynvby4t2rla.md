## What Flutter VS React Native: Which one to Choose - Predicted Deep Analysis 2022-23

You are about to start App Development and confuse which technology to use? And with ease to quick, fast, with no such a extra amount and not a big deal with time, then we will be covering the whole bunch of related questions every beginners face during this phase.

**In this article, we will go deep down to the best of two players running in today world: FLUTTER vs REACT NATIVE and will do deep analysis along with the visualization.**

## FLUTTER
Flutter is an Open-Source Technology to develop Cross Platform Applications, created by Google. It let you create Mobile Applications both for iOS & Android, and also Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and for the Web and all this with a **Single Codebase**. It's been first released by Google in 2017.

### Flutter Technology
Flutter is Object-Oriented-Programming based and it uses programming language Dart. If you are a little familiar with Object oriented programming and also Java Programming language, it will be easy for one to learn flutter.

### Popular Apps Created with Flutter
Most famous Applications created with Flutter Technology are:                                                                
1. Google Ads.
2. Postmuse â€“ Instagram photo editing app.
3. eBay.
4. Alibaba.
5. Tencent.

### Flutter Statistics - Growth during Past Years
During a survey, it's been conducted that Flutter is used by almost 43% developers. and it's been improving day-by-day.

## REACT NATIVE
React Native is open-source framework developed by Meta Inc. (formerly as Facebook), released in 2015 and it's open to built Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and VR by using React framework.

### Popular Apps Created with React Native

1.  Instagram.
1. Tesla.
1. Facebook.
1. Walmart

### React Native Statistics - Growth during Past Years
During past years, React Native is being one of best developing framework, loved most of developers and according to a survey, it's being loved by 42% of developers.

## Comparison between FLUTTER & RECAT NATIVE
### Development & Deployment Performance 
Flutter has in-built feature "hot-reload" enables it's developer to develop the app and display faster before the app being build to at its last phase. and you can change in code with faster development being showing at that time during development phase which may be consider as "developing and testing at the same time". 

On the other hand, React Native has 3 parts to run Framework 1) 
1. Native Thread.
1. JavaScript thread.
1. Bridge.

and main issue occur when you pass other component or an unnecessarily component which let react-native slow down their performance level.

Also, let assume a music app. During scrolling for songs and pages continuously changing which let app consume more RAM. So, react native need a bridge to interact between native modules while flutter don't need one which increase their performance.

While at some point, React Native is beast incase of Web performance and Flutter is best for Mobile performance.
### Cost & Demand
React Native is based on Javascript which most of developers already know of it and there's also great community of it.

While looking at Flutter, it's new generation technology. and it's community as compared to react native is large. Though many developers already goes in to the flutter market, although quite challenging for both techies, and yet it's keep booming day-by-day which may overcome community during coming days.

### Features
Flutter and React Native are both develop by top tech giant, Google and Meta(formerly Facebook), which overcome most of technological market.

You may need native apps sometime through react native or you may need some excellent functionality through flutter but as it depends on your choice, your need and according to your functionality.

### Design
In Flutter, the app will look similar on all devices except it changes a little based on device OS version and model of device. and some features remain unchanged unless they are change intentionally. 

While in React Native, most features are from native appearance and during updates, it update automatically to remain their functionality, application look and provide best user experience.

## Conclusion
As both, Flutter and React Native, are in their development stage and large community of developers are still getting through various developments and contributing but there's no true winner.

Every developer need their framework according to their need & demand and with the time. You may need to develop app using flutter as per your choice and need. 

I personally working on flutter because of their widgets and community and everyday, developers are contributing in someway and not that react native is bad, same is for this framework. There's no prior scale to choose which one is best, but this may be of your choice and your scale of selecting from two of best framework because both are built by top tech giant.
